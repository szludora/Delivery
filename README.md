# Delivery Game
Today, I created a small game where you can pick up a package and deliver it to a customer.
### Some small mechanics:
- If you hit something you shouldn't, your speed will decrease.
- However, if you find a booster (a yellow circle), you'll get a speed boost.
- When you pick up a package, the car changes color to indicate that you're carrying a package to deliver.
